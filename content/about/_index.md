Welcome to my blog.

I'm a huge fan of all things technology and product. In the not so distant past, I was a technology lawyer turned e-commerce entrepreneur.  Over the years, I've worked for both well-established large corporates (in the legal and financial services industries) as well as smart, ambitious start-ups and growing tech companies in the media, ad-tech, e-commerce and AR/VR & design software sectors. I've always been fascinated by artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies and recently started coding in Python and diving deeper into the AI world. 

I started this blog to share what I'm learning, reading and thinking about in this space as well as learnings from my past as an entrepreneur and lawyer. I hope you find it all interesting, helpful and/or entertaining! 

Thanks for reading,

Rachel
