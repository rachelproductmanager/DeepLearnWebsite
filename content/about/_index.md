Welcome to my blog.

I'm an amateur Python coder, technology enthusiast, ex-tech and corporate lawyer turned e-commerce entrepreneur. I've always been fascinated by artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies and so decided to start this blog to share what I'm learning, reading and thinking about in this space. 

Thanks for reading,

Rachel
