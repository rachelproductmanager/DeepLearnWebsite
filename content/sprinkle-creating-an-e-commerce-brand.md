We started Sprinkle, an innovative, next generation spice brand in May 2018.

The Sprinkle idea was born out of my own love of cooking and flavour and a frustration with the inferior quality spices found in unloved supermarket spice aisles everywhere.

We wanted to introduce people to the magic of Tel-Aviv's iconic spice markets by helping customers experience what fresh, aromatic spice blends inspired by global cuisines really taste like and empower them to be healthy and cook incredible meals for their family and friends with minimal effort.

## **1.Vision, mission & business model**

#### **Vision**

Create an independent, innovative, Australian spice brand that brings together a community of food lovers and avid home cooks, inspires and empowers them to eat better and live better. The tagline was ‘**_Small Batch. Big Flavour_**’.

#### **Mission**

Sprinkle set out to shake up the spice industry and do for spices what the craft movement did for chocolate and coffee - introduce consumers to fresh, flavourful and ethically sourced spices. Sprinkle’s mission was to empower busy, health conscious home cooks and foodies to transform everyday cooking easily and quickly.

#### **DTC model**

Fundamentally, our goal was to be a **direct-to-consumer** (DTC) brand, i.e. sell directly to consumers through our website, dispensing with traditional middlemen such as retailers, supermarkets and distributors (and a long chain of spice traders) who stood between spice growers in developing countries and consumers in the West.

#### **Strategy**

Our strategy was to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by delivering an exceptional product and designing an enhanced, end-to-end digital user experience that would delight customers and exceed expectations. We devised unique ways to reach and engage with our customers mainly through digital channels, which was quite revolutionary, especially for this product category.

#### **Manufacturing**

Manufacturing was a core part of our strategy and business model - we aimed to have a vertically integrated operation and fully control all elements of the supply chain - from sourcing our raw materials directly from select growers to packing and shipping the product ourselves, and everything in between.

## **2. Inspiration**

We were inspired by world-leading DTC consumer, lifestyle and food brands who are at the forefront of e-commerce and digital innovation such as [Net-a-Porter](https://www.net-a-porter.com/), [GOOP](https://goop.com/), [Food52](https://food52.com/), [Dandelion Chocolate](https://store.dandelionchocolate.com/pages/home), the [Honest Company](https://www.honest.com/), [Black Rifle Coffee](https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/), [All Birds](https://www.allbirds.com/) and [Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com/).

We tapped into a growing global trend of increased consumer demand for independent, ethical and authentic brands that offered higher quality products and connected with customer values and aspirations. The market for organic spices and condiments was predicted to grow at 5% CAGR and be worth approximately $40bn by 2025. Additionally, celebrity chefs such as Yotam [Ottolenghi](https://ottolenghi.co.uk/) and [Jamie Oliver](https://www.jamieoliver.com/) were popularising home cooking and introducing people to Middle Eastern cooking, exotic spices and other lesser known condiments and flavours which resulted in increased demand for these products.

## **3.Brand design (logo, colours, labels, packaging & stationery)**

The Sprinkle **brand** **design** was a central part of the product development process and something we spent a lot of time on refining. What started as a rough idea quickly transformed into a vibrant brand with its own distinct personality. The **brand name** itself - ‘Sprinkle’ - was chosen because it’s catchy, memorable and short. It embodied the product and central brand message - that cooking with spices is easy - it only requires a sprinkle.

We wanted to create a fun, engaging and user-friendly spice brand (in contrast to the trite, tired and uninspiring spice and condiments brands out there) that people would enjoy using daily in their kitchen.

We followed the following key principles:

**1/** **Clean, modern & minimalistic design** - Because spices and spice blends originate from different parts of the world and a variety of global cuisines, our **brand colour palette** reflects **5 regions** which were the categories ‘housing’ our product collection (Middle East, North Africa, Europe, Americas and Australia). Our **logo and brand fonts** were also designed to capture the brand’s playful spirit.

**2/ Maintain consistency across all mediums** and ensure the brand identity seamlessly flows through the website, products and packaging as well as digital content, marketing emails and social presence.

**3/ Packaging** **isn’t an afterthought** - we carefully selected quality glass jars and designed a custom branded shipping box - packaging was purposely designed to be highly functional, aligned with our freshness values, consistent with the brand’s premium look and feel and deliver a remarkable user experience overall. Also, our packaging was **tailored for digital** (different to how you might design packaging for bricks and mortar retail). Labels, gift boxes and the signature Sprinkle shipping box were highly functional but also intended to be bright, colourful, eye catching and instagrammable.

**4/ End-to-end personalised experience** - In e-commerce the shopping experience doesn’t end at checkout. It’s important to ensure a remarkable shopping experience at every customer touchpoint in the shopping funnel (from website to shipping to unboxing and beyond). Inspired by e-commerce giants such as Net-a-Porter, our products included premium tissue paper wrapping, custom stickers, a custom-designed **Thank You Card** with a handwritten message as well as a Sprinkle **Intro Card** that told customers a bit more about the brand’s story and mission and helped them find useful recipes and cooking inspiration.

## **4.Website design/UX**

Our website was thoughtfully designed to follow **e-commerce UX best practices**:

* **Don’t make users think -** the website was designed to be as obvious and self explanatory as possible (we went through several iterations and experiments to get it right). We wanted to enable visitors to either easily search and find what they’re after or browse without getting stuck or frustrated. Customers are short on time and attention so it’s important to help them get the job done with minimal need for thinking and learning your website’s layout, product range or shipping process. We decluttered the Home page to make it easy to navigate and product pages had clear, easy to digest sections.

* **Mobile friendly** - our website was mobile compatible and fast as many shoppers today turn to their mobile phones first.

![](/images/screen-shot-2020-08-26-at-17-25-57.png)

* **Product photography in scale** - product photography was high resolution and clear on scale and detail, so consumers can get a sense of the product’s size and what it contains. We also had pinch gestures allowing users to zoom in on products both on mobile and desktop. Each product had a hero image and visible thumbnails making the product page quite visual and transparent to build trust and enable a frictionless experience.

* **Display the right amount of information** - we aimed to make product pages informative and helpful, providing recipe links, ingredients information, product uses and shipping information, answering most questions a user would have when landing on a product page. Copy was kept consistent with the brand voice and tone (friendly, helpful, casual).

  ![](/images/screen-shot-2020-08-26-at-17-29-14.png)
* **Easy and quick checkout process** - checkout was simple and fast with minimal fields and a clear, informative confirmation email to follow. You could check out as a guest and account creation was optional.
* **Payment options** - we offered easy and commonly used payment options (credit card, PayPal, Google) via a secure payment gateway (Stripe).
* **Product reviews and ratings** - these were clearly displayed for every product on the product page and viewable on the Home page as well.

## **5.Product range**

Once we established product-market fit and based on customer feedback, we expanded our product range to include: **Bundles** - ready-to-purchase boxes of 3,4 or 8 products enabling customers to quickly pick a combination suited to their tastes or cooking goals; **Gift Boxes** - 4 types of 'foodie' gift box catering for various tastes (BBQ, Middle Eastern flavours, Die hard foodies); and complementary **Pantry items** from select artisan Australian small batch producers (such as organic olive oils, harissa and preserved lemons).
