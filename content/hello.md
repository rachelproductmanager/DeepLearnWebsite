“**Deep Learning is a superpower. With it you can make a computer see, synthesize novel art, translate languages, render a medical diagnosis, or build pieces of a car that can drive itself. If that isn’t a superpower, I don’t know what is.**” _- Andrew Ng, Founder of deeplearning.ai and Coursera_

## **Rise of the machines**

Artificial intelligence has become a popular marketing buzzword in recent years. AI is helping well established brands innovate in unprecedented ways and reach, engage, convert and retain customers through smart content curation, voice and image search, analytics, ad targeting, customer service chat bots, dynamic pricing and hyper personalisation.

Global brands leveraging machine learning to improve products, services and customer interactions include:

* [Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/using-machine-learning-to-improve-streaming-quality-at-netflix-9651263ef09f) who’s known for using machine learning to improve its streaming quality and cope with the challenges of a growing global audience with diverse viewing behaviours and a multitude of devices and networks. Netflix also uses AI to improve its [content recommendation](https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-at-spark-ai-summit-2018-5304749ed7fa) and personalisation engine.
* [Sephora](https://www.indigo9digital.com/blog/learn-how-sephora-is-using-chatbots-to-create-a-better-customer-experience)’s AI powered chatbot, Sephora Assistant, allows customers to book makeup appointments using Facebook Messenger. This makes the process of booking makeup appointments quick and easy for younger customers, a valuable segment and increased bookings by 11% in the US.
* [Unilever](https://digiday.com/marketing/artificial-intelligence-influencing-unilevers-marketing/) utilised AI-powered marketing tools to create Ben & Jerry’s new line of cereal flavoured ice cream.
* [Nike](https://www.businessinsider.com/nikes-new-tech-creates-custom-sneakers-in-under-2-hours-2017-9?IR=T)’s partnered with AI to create custom sneakers in under 2 hours allowing customers to design their own shoes in-store.
* [Alibaba](https://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-starts-using-fashion-ai-technology-2018-7?IR=T) launched a “FashionAI” concept store using intelligent garment tags, smart mirrors and a virtual wardrobe feature in its app to help customers uncover product information, get fashion recommendations and build entire looks in-store or at home.
* [Chase Bank](https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/chase-commits-ai-after-machines-outperform-humans-copywriting-trials/2187606?) embraced AI tools for its ads after trials showed machine-written copy outperformed humans.
* [BMW](https://www.autonews.com/article/20180906/MOBILITY/180909856/bmw-introduces-intelligent-personal-assistant-communications-system) introduced an AI-enabled personal assistant into their cars.

A recent O’Reilly global survey on the [state of AI adoption in 2020](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise-2020/) found that **85%** of companies are shifting deployment from prototype to production and more than **50%** of global organisations identify themselves as mature AI adopters. Interestingly, almost **25%** of respondents identified lack of institutional support as the biggest obstacle to AI adoption. In other words, most companies are experimenting with AI (great!) but early adopters are still facing major challenges around understanding what AI can do for the business (often described as a solution seeking a problem challenge), how to run an AI project successfully and how to find the right skill sets and talent to launch and scale AI projects.

Which begs the question, what problems can AI help solve? What does creating “AI-powered” products or services actually mean? And how do companies successfully launch these products?

## **AI For Everyone**

Full disclosure: having been a technology lawyer for years and then an e-commerce entrepreneur, I’ve crossed paths with artificial intelligence and machine learning along the way. I’ve always found it fascinating but never quite had the opportunity to take a deeper dive into these technologies. I recently decided to brave the “[AI For Everyone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone)” course - an online course on Coursera taught by AI guru, Dr. Andrew Ng, a world-renowned AI technology leader, founding lead of Google Brain, co-founder of Coursera and a prominent AI educator.

I found the course incredibly useful - it demystifies basic AI concepts for non-engineers, skilfully explains pretty complex ideas, helps you understand AI technologies and clarifies AI terminology (such as the difference between AI, machine learning and deep learning which are often used interchangeably). Andrew Ng also breaks down how AI projects are built and how to spot AI growth opportunities in your company. He shares a simple mental model for thinking about AI innovation and how it can be applied to solve problems in any industry. The course also gives a brief overview of AI ethical issues, how AI is impacting society and the challenges ahead in living through this technological change.

> “AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology is now **poised to transform every industry**, just as electricity did 100 years ago. Between now and 2030, it will create an estimated $13 trillion of GDP growth. While it has already created tremendous value in leading technology companies such as Google, Baidu, Microsoft and Facebook, **much of the additional waves of value creation will go beyond the software sector**”

_- Landing AI, The AI Transformation Playbook_

## **What makes a true AI company**

Andrew Ng makes an interesting observation: simply bolting on or retrofitting machine learning technologies onto a typical company **doesn’t make it an “AI company”**, just as we’ve learned in the internet era that simply having a website doesn’t make a company a true ”internet company” (e.g. a shopping mall + a website doesn’t amount to a true e-commerce company).

Today, it’s common knowledge that a true internet company optimises for things that the internet does really well, such as:

* using A/B testing to trial new website features/pages;
* having short iteration times so it can release products and test the market fast;
* making data-driven strategic decisions based on advanced analytics to analyse and improve digital metrics such as customer conversion, satisfaction, engagement and retention; and
* using technology to deliver a better end-to-end customer experience (whether through AI-powered personalisation, customer service or content marketing, smart recommendations and behaviour predictions).

A true internet company also organises itself with digitally focused roles such as product managers, UX designers and software engineers, each with respective responsibilities and workflows that map back to digital goals and KPIs. Similarly, **for your company to become great at AI, you will have to organise your company to do the things that AI lets you do really well:**

* **_Allocate financial and human resources to systematically execute on multiple valuable AI projects_**: AI companies have the outsourced and/or in-house technology and talent to systematically execute on multiple AI projects that deliver direct value to the business. AI projects involve intensive data collection, model training and iteration, deployment to test users and further learning, iteration and maintenance to keep the model accurate and useful. While AI can give your product or service superpowers, it’s not a magic bullet and requires commitment, investment and a lot of trial and error to validate assumptions and get to the right solutions.
* **_Sufficient understanding of AI_**: There should be general understanding of AI, with appropriate processes in place to systematically identify and select valuable AI projects to work on. It’s important to have the right people with the right skills in place to be able to analyse what AI can or cannot do for your business and identify and execute the highest value projects.
* **_Strategic direction_**: The company’s strategy is broadly aligned to succeed in an AI-powered future. Andrew Ng recommends devising a thoughtful AI strategy _after_ (not before) you’ve experienced working with AI: “_Once teams start to see the success of the initial AI projects and form a deeper understanding of AI, you will be able to identify the places where AI can create the most value and focus resources on those areas_.”

## **5 key elements of an AI transformation plan**

One of the most useful aspects of the AI For Everyone course is Andrew’s [AI Transformation Playbook](https://landing.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/LandingAI_Transformation_Playbook_11-19.pdf) which explains in simple, practical terms how you can lead your company into the AI era. It’s important to understand that AI technologies aren’t just for companies like Google, Netflix and Amazon. As with the internet, everyone can - and should - make use of AI’s superpowers, no matter what sector you’re in.

> “The important thing is to get the flywheel spinning so that your AI team can gain momentum.” - Andrew Ng

The 5 key steps in a successful AI transformation plan according to Andrew Ng’s **AI Transformation Playbook** (with some commentary of my own) are:

**1. Execute pilot projects to gain momentum**

* **Choose the right problem to solve** - Your first few AI projects don’t have to be large or deliver huge business value straight out of the gates - they should be meaningful enough to help your company gain familiarity with AI and convince others in the company to invest in further AI projects but they should not be so small that others would consider it trivial.
* **Think about the biggest AI opportunity** (i.e. _not_ necessarily the biggest problem the business is facing) - consider current AI technologies (e.g. speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing) and how they might be used to improve your product.
* **Aim for short term success** - Build AI solutions that start showing traction within 6-12 months. Don’t aim for projects that will take years to show results as that would impede your momentum.
* **Check feasibility** - Get trusted AI engineers to do due diligence on a project before kickoff to confirm its feasibility (i.e. check that AI technology can do what you think it can do within your time frame and other constraints).
* **Set measurable goals and clear metrics** - have a clearly defined and measurable objective that creates business value (but again it doesn’t have to relate to the main revenue generating aspect of your company; it might be easier to tackle a less important feature first, gain confidence in the technology and move on to bigger goals).

**2. Build an in-house AI team**

* Outsourcing to AI experts might help you get faster results for your pilot project BUT you should look to **form a centralised AI team** that can help the whole company accelerate its AI competitive advantage. This AI team could sit under the CTO, CIO, or CDO function or be led by a dedicated CAIO (Chief AI Officer).
* The new AI team will execute an **initial sequence of cross-functional projects** to support different divisions/business units with AI projects and move on to deliver larger and more valuable AI projects down the line.
* In conjunction with hiring for an AI team, you’ll want to develop **company-wide platforms and standards** (e.g. unified data warehousing and data governance frameworks) that are useful to multiple divisions/business units and essential for a successful AI strategy.
* An **effective AI team** would include the following **new roles**: a Machine Learning Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, and AI Product Manager - those are different to digital teams from the pre-AI era.

**3. Provide broad AI training** **& education**

* Online courses taught by AI experts such as **Coursera, Udacity, Udemy and Data Camp, Amazon books, and YouTube videos and AI podcasts** make it is accessible, easy and cost effective (especially in the remote working era we’re in right now) to train up large numbers of employees in new skills such as AI, machine learning, data science and programming. This can also be combined with on-site expert training.
* It’s important for executives and leaders to understand AI concepts, how to craft an AI strategy and what AI-skills their employees might need in the future. But I think it’s also as important to think about a wider “**AI PR**” initiative - how might you increase your non-technical staff’s **general awareness** of AI in order to drive a wider understanding and adoption of AI technology across the company. There are many misconceptions out there about what AI is - many people fear or worry about it and don’t fully understand AI’s true potential to improve their ability to perform their jobs, and how it can positively impact the company’s success and bottom line. It’s vital to **educate** people **across all lines of business** (not just in the exec or tech teams) about the power and benefits of AI (especially given the fact that AI tools can nowadays be used by sales, marketing, HR, content, operations etc).

**4. Develop an AI strategy**

* Once teams start to see the success of the pilot AI projects and form a deeper understanding of AI, identify where AI can create the most value for the business and focus resources on those areas with the goal of **using AI to build your competitive moat**.
* A good place to start is to **leverage AI to create an advantage specific to your industry** sector (rather than trying to compete with Amazon or Google) and to build **several AI assets** that would be tricky for your competitors to easily copy.
* Align your strategy with the **“Virtuous circle of AI”** positive-feedback loop which makes it harder for competitors to break into: a better product leads to more users which lead to more data which results in a better product.
* Establishing a forward-looking **data strategy is key**, including acquiring data strategically (i.e. thinking about what data is valuable and how you can monetise it), setting up unified data warehouses and identifying what data isn’t valuable).

**5. Develop internal and external communications**

Communicating with the outside world and within your company about your AI strategy, AI product and AI vision is key - think about your messaging and positioning to investors, government relationships, the press, customers/users, partners and talent/recruitment.

> “ AI will likely bring significant benefits to your customers, so make sure the appropriate marketing and product roadmap messages are disseminated.”

## **Strategic scaling**

A recent [Accenture Research Report](https://www.accenture.com/au-en/insights/artificial-intelligence/ai-investments?c=acn_au_artificialintelgoogle_11082058&n=psgs_1119&gclid=Cj0KCQjwsuP5BRCoARIsAPtX_wHwoYC6XYGQEfyhhgSeV6V1WP5B9tpGXW3bHJiHCTbMh6-4BIOxSewaAgzqEALw_wcB) shows that **84%** of C-suite executives believe they must leverage AI to achieve their growth objectives, yet almost **80%** report they struggle with how to scale. Many executives believe that **if they don’t scale AI in the next five years, they risk going out of business entirely**.

Meanwhile, companies in that study that are **strategically scaling** AI report **nearly three times the return from AI investments**, compared to companies pursuing siloed proof of concepts.

It’s clear that to achieve AI success at scale and speed, it’s key for companies to do 3 things well:

1. **Intentionally drive AI strategy** - successful AI companies have a clear 1-2 year AI strategic plan and **instil the right capabilities and mindset within the organisation**, regardless of the company’s size. This involves having a clear enterprise vision, accountability, metrics, and governance to break down silos.
2. **Tune out “the noise” surrounding data** - recognise the importance of business-critical data and identify financial, marketing and consumer data as **priority domains**. If you are more adept at **structuring and managing data** you’ll be much more likely to wield a larger, more accurate data set which, in turn, will lead to better AI product performance.
3. **Treat AI as a team sport** - AI strategy should be championed by the CEO (not just the CIO or IT or data teams) who must make clear AI is a priority for the organisation. This can be achieved by embedding multi-disciplinary “AI teams” throughout the organisation which have clear sponsorship from the top to ensure alignment with the C-suite vision. These teams are most often headed by the Chief AI, Data or Analytics Officer and are comprised of data scientists; machine learning, data and AI engineers; AI product managers, data governance and other specialists. This enables faster cultural and behavioural changes to take place and signals your AI leadership goals both internally and externally.
